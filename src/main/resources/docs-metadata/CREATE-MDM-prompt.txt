I need you to implement a Python utility for Joget metadata management.

Please read the complete implementation specification from: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md

After reading the spec, please:
1. Confirm you understand the requirements (especially the two nested LOV patterns)
2. Create the initial project structure (Phase 0)
3. Ask me any clarifying questions before beginning implementation
4. Then proceed with Phase 1 implementation

Key context:
- I'm working on a Farmers Registry system using Joget DX8
- We have 39 CSV metadata files in data/metadata/
- Some use traditional FK relationships, others use subcategory source pattern
- The subcategory source pattern (MD25/MD27) is critical - child CSVs don't have FK columns
